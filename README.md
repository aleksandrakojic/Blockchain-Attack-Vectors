# Blockchain-Attack-Vectors

The Blockchain-Attack-Vectors repository acts as an Open Directory for the Web3 community, which is built to reference, categorize and mitigate the various attack vectors on a blockchain. This repo consists of a category-wise explanation of the attack behaviours and prevention strategies for vulnerabilities specific to the Web3 ecosystem.

This repo is a work in progress, and we invite contributors from the Web3 space to help us design a framework that is a go-to stop for budding Web3 enthusiasts and security researchers.

## 🎯 Aim

- With this repo, we aim to bring about a **sense of awareness in the community about the different types of attack vectors** that have been the cause of the loss of millions in the past.
- Provide the **security researchers, developers, auditors and engineers** a one-stop knowledge base for better understanding.

## ⚙️ Features

- **Comprehensive Catalog:** This repo acts as an extensive knowledge base for anyone looking to build a career in Web3. The attack vectors are classified extensively with an in-depth explanation.
- **Mitigation Techniques:** Each attack vector also contains Mitigation techniques to get a deeper understanding of how to prevent/mitigate the attack.
- **Real-world Use Cases:** Along with the attack understanding, readers will also come across real-world hacks (wherever applicable) and learn how the vector can be exploited.
- **Community Building:** This is a community-leveraged framework wherein we encourage community members from Web3 to impart their knowledge and help other members as well.

## ⏩ How Can You Contribute?

- Explore the catalogue and get an understanding of how the framework has been designed.
- If you think something is missing, *create a new fork* of this repo and get started.
- Pick a category and make your submission for publication.
- Once reviewed, the attack vector will be published on the repo. 🚀
- You can also let us know if you find any discrepancies or a need for change in the existing content.
